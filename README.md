There are three main ways to interact with the examples in this project:

1. Enable the modules and use them within Drupal. Not all modules will have
obvious things to see within Drupal. For instance, while the Page and Form API
examples will show you forms, the Database API example will not show you much
within Drupal itself.

2. Read the code. Much effort has gone into making the example code readable,
not only in terms of the code itself, but also the extensive inline comments
and documentation blocks.

3. Browse the code and documentation on the web. There are two main places to
do this:

* https://api.drupal.org/api/examples is the main API site for all of Drupal.
It has all manner of cross-linked references between the example code and the
APIs being demonstrated.

* http://drupalcode.org/project/examples.git allows you to browse the git
repository for the Examples project.
